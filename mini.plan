POC0 – mini cinema

[x] simple one page app
[x] one big html video player
[x] mini cinema app, just index.html
[x] two or three other visible modules
[x] list of available movies from torrent
[x] some mini control over getting files
[x] webtorrent system in the background
[x] use torrent infohash as collection anchor

POC1 – future

[ ] nostr-backed bib / “db”
[ ] richer Herzog catalog metadata
[ ] better state logging / diagnostics

BIG FAT NOTE – TORRENT ENGINE OPTION

Before going too deep into custom WebTorrent plumbing, consider whether to
leverage https://github.com/webtor-io/ as the underlying torrent infrastructure
for WHDA / cinema instead of rolling and maintaining everything in-browser and
on our own seeder:
- webtor-io already exposes HTTP/streaming interfaces on top of torrents
- it could simplify seeding, metadata fetching, and peer discovery
- we’d still keep Nostr + infohash bag as the catalog layer

BIG FAT NOTE – VIDEO / PLAYER LAYER

Also consider replacing the hand-rolled `<video>` UI with DPlayer:
- https://github.com/DIYgod/DPlayer
- clean, modern HTML5 player with playlist + danmaku support
- can be wired to accept a MediaSource / streaming URL produced by our torrent
  layer (webtorrent/webtor/etc.) instead of direct file URLs
- keeps playback concerns separate from WHDA + Nostr + torrent plumbing
- could also pair with hlsjs-p2p-engine to get HLS + P2P:
  - https://github.com/cdnbye/hlsjs-p2p-engine
  - idea: torrent layer (or webtor) → HLS stream → hls.js + cdnbye for P2P +
    DPlayer as the front-end player
  - also study the Novage p2p-media-loader DPlayer HLS demo as a reference:
    - https://novage.com.ua/p2p-media-loader/demo.html?player=dplayer_hls

BIG FAT NOTE – BLAZE / REFERENCE APP

Blaze (https://github.com/blenderskool/blaze) is a good reference for how a
multi-torrent WebTorrent app can look in production, but it solves a slightly
different problem:
- Blaze is focused on ad-hoc file sharing "rooms" between peers
- cinema/WHDA is a curated, long-lived archive keyed by infohash/Nostr WHDA
- we should treat Blaze as inspiration and code reference, not embed it
- in particular, Blaze's WebTorrent wiring and multi-torrent handling patterns
  could be useful when designing our dedicated seeder node or richer client

BIG FAT NOTE – FUTURE DOC SOURCES

If we ever need to expand the Herzog/related documentary catalog, this YouTube
playlist is a perfect candidate to base future WHDA entries on:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nV_awXI9XJY&list=PLav47HAVZMjnTFVZL-aImCQIC0uLZtNCz
We would still treat it as a reference source for metadata and hashes, not as
an embedded player.
